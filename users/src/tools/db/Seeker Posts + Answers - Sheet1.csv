"i’m sick of having a period

i’m sick of bleeding out i don’t even get that bad of a period compared to other people, i just hate being able to feel blood come out of me constantly. and i also get horrible back pain when i’m on my period too not to mention i got it while sick this week so now every time i sneeze its like a waterfall i swear i don’t want children just make this stop omg.";I would definitely recommend talking to your doctor/gyno about options that will work best for you. It might take some experimenting with different options, but I’ve successfully avoided having periods for the majority of my adulthood (I’m also childfree). ;You can talk to a specialist about taking pills. For some women, it is possible to take pills for all days of the month and not . But you MUST talk to your Doctor about it because it is not an option for everyone and also you can't just take any pill because of the side effects.;
"Terrible time at the gynecologist

So I’ve been avoiding going to the the gyne not because I was afraid but because I have a very busy schedule and I never have time but anyways decided to go because for the longest time my periods have been so irregular and very heavy. At the appointment the first thing she asked me was if I had unprotected sex recently and I said yes. She then looked at me in a very judgy way and said I likely have an STD. I don’t know if I’m over reacting but surely she should check me first and get the results back before freaking me out/ making an assumption?
";Change doctors and report her, if you can. That was so unprofessional. Don’t be discouraged from going to see a gynaecologist in the future, just don’t ever go to see her again. Find one you’re comfortable with, someone who respects patients and treats them like human beings.;I would leave her a bad review & make a complaint.;https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/17p28hh/terrible_time_at_the_gynecologist/
"How to deal with health anxiety over my fertility

I have had irregular periods most of my life but still get periods more often than not. No pain or other weird symptoms. My blood tests came back normal but I still can't help but worry about my ability to have kids later in life. ";I navigated mental health issues around my fertility. I am currently expecting and have already had 1 successful pregnancy, but my journey to becoming a parent happened later in life due to my fertility issues (I am in my late-ish-30s with my second pregnancy and am beyond thrilled to be able to bring a second child into my family). Not everyone's path to parenthood is straight, and in fact 40% of pregnant people experience miscarriages or failed pregnancies before experiencing a successful one...so keep that in mind.;When dealing with fertility anxiety it can be really easy to get lost in the future and forget what's within your control NOW to figuring out how and when you want to start building your family. I would look up or reach out to find fertility support groups, or a therapist who specializes in infertility related issues.;https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1ejd7gt/how_to_deal_with_health_anxiety_over_my_fertility/
"Suggest some good app/ device for tracking periods and other menstrual things.

i been using a lot of period trackers and really not satisfied with the accuracy of any of it as it feels like they just give a reminder after 28 days as a set standard and not really studies your period cycle to give personalized accuracy or health scores.
I've heard of various smart rings coming in the market like for ultrahuman, gabit, Noise etc but not sure which one to buy but really impressed by the features of noise smart ring as it provides a lot of data on women's health rather than the others but i am very dicey. Kindly recommend girlies.";There isn’t an app that is going to be 100% accurate. While some will utilize an algorithm to predict future cycles, it’s not an exact science. It’s just taking information you input compared to an average cycle;I use Clue. It has loads of information, it analyzes your cycle, and they are based in Europe and make part of their commitment not selling or sharing any information.;https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1dqdoaw/suggest_some_good_app_device_for_tracking_periods/
"My boyfriend unknowingly gave me hpv. I need some advice

I'm feeling pretty upset right now and have a lot of questions, and could use some advice. I found out my bf of nearly 3 years gave me a strain of high risk hpv (I'm vaccinated and this one is not covered by the shots sadly). My doctor said there is no way my boyfriend would know of his hpv w/o symptoms, so I'm not mad at him. But, I am frustrated.";HPV is incredibly common - all strains - I know this feels very real and very scary, but please do your research. Most ppl never even know they have HPV, most ppl clear HPV without ever displaying symptoms. Yes some strains can cause cancer, but with proper medical care that can be prevented. ;I was in your shoes. Got that info and freaked out, knowing nothing about it and what it could do to me down the road. When I asked my doctor, she said that it could normally clear up on its own and to get regular PAP exams throughout your life;https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/opm35e/my_boyfriend_unknowingly_gave_me_hpv_i_need_some/
