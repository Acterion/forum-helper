Emotional Support - A,29,I have a bump under my breast. Iâ€™m embarrassed/afraid to schedule an appointment with my doctor,I think itâ€™s a cyst. Iâ€™ve had it for about 6 months now and I think I should go see my primary doctor but I donâ€™t know how to tell them. Should I tell the office scheduler when I call that itâ€™s because I have a bump on my boob or should I just say I want to come in for a check up or a concern I have? Iâ€™m 25 and Iâ€™ve never had any issues like this so Iâ€™m kind of embarrassed and scared to talk about it. Iâ€™m a private and shy person so itâ€™s hard for me to talk about something private.,"I understand that you feel uncomfortable. But I can promise you that whatever you tell them, they've heard worse. I would call and say that you'd like to make an appointment for a checkup. And when they ask what the nature of your appointment is, you can say ""I've noticed a lump on my breast and would like to get the doctor's advice"". Truthfully though, I'd recommend a gynecologist vs your primary physician. Also, I don't want to scare you, but please always get any new lumps checked out by a physician immediately. 6 months is way too long to go and self-diagnosing can be dangerous.",
Emotional Support - B,35,I desperately need to make my first OBGYN appointment. Iâ€™ve lost sleep over it for years. Any words of advice? Encouragement?,"Iâ€™m 22 and have never been to the gynecologist. I know I need to. I think I would be less scared if I was sexually active, but Iâ€™m a virgin and probably will be for a while. I canâ€™t even use tampons without it hurting. I know I have to go, sooner rather than later. But Iâ€™m terrified. ðŸ˜­ Definitely thinking about looking into getting some type of anxiety meds to take beforehand if Iâ€™m allowed to take those. There are some days where I can talk myself out of the anxiety (even almost booked an appointment a couple weeks ago), and there are other days where I stay up almost all night reading horror stories. Hopefully Iâ€™ll end up going on a day I can talk myself down. Lol Any advice, words of encouragement, and positive experiences are welcome.","Maybe have a friend drive you there and wait for you. It can help cut the tension, and if you take a medication for the anxiety, you shouldn't drive. The doctor may be able to tell you why it hurts to use tampons as well. You can do this! It gets easier, I promise.",
Instructional Support - C,28,Conception rates,What are the chances that a woman will get pregnant from any single act of vaginal intercourse without protection?,It depends on the time during your period that sex occurs. To find more out about that research women's cycles and ovulation.,
Instructional Support - E,20,Periods and weight,"Hello, first all apologies if this is a sensitive topic but I'm trying to test a hypothesis and I'm hoping everyone who chooses to respond/answer will be honest. My theory is that periods feel more intense and painful if the woman is overweight/obese as well as not physically active and not taking care of themselves. I understand that the concept of being overweight is rather subjective because we see each other differently as well as what society sees. So the best thing I can think of is taking BMI as factor, which non-biased. Between 18.5 and 24.9, you're in the healthy weight range. Between 25 and 29.9, you're in the overweight range. Between 30 and 39.9, you're in the obese range.",I've always had horrific periods. Even when I was 105 lbs they were horrible and being obese hasn't changed it in anyway,
Instructional Support - F,98,Best sleeping position for breast pain?,"My boobs are always sore, I don't know the exact cause but that isn't what this is about. Also I have b cup boobs. What sleeping position is better for breast pain, sleeping on my stomach with my boobs on the pillow OR sleeping on my side?","I sleep on my side and hold a pillow to my chest, it helps so much with the pain",
